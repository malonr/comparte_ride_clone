Comparte Ride was a carpooling platform developed on 2016 as an alternative for Mexico City inhabitants during an air pollution alert where the car usage was restricted and over 1.1 million cars were banned from the streets.

This is a clone [repository of the original](https://github.com/pablotrinidad/cride-platzi/) one that was used to teach Django Rest Framework on Platzi.
